Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This project contains one R script called run_analysis() that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set `(tidydata.txt)` with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Test Files:
x_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt

###Train Files:
x_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt

###Other Files:
features.txt: contains the values that will become the column labels

activity_labels: contains the id and label (descriptive activity name) (WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING)
